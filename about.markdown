My name is Thymios and I am a fifth year PhD candidate (expecting to graduate by May 2023) in the Computer Science (CS) department at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) where I investigate machine learning for audio processing problems with my advisor Prof. Paris Smaragdis. During my PhD, I have also conducted research at Google AI, Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL) and Reality Labs at Meta (ex. FRL). Before that, I graduated with a diploma (Bachelor and MEng equivalent) in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) from the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA).

My current research focuses on developing and utilizing efficient neural networks towards more generalizable audio and audio-visual source separation. I am particularly interested in unsupervised ways of learning directly from mixtures of sounds as well as federated learning algorithms which work under realistic non-IID settings. You might also be interested in the work done by my amazing labmates and friends at the UIUC: Jonah Casebeer, Zhepei Wang, and Krishna Subramani.
